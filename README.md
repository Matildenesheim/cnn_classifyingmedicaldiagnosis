The sample dataset contains 5606 X- Ray images and 244 class labels. The dataset was down sampled to just 3547 X-Ray images with 2 class labels being ‘No Finding’ and ‘Infiltration’. The data was split into training and test datasets, again with 80% of the data in the training set and 20% in the test set.
